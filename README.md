# Expense Tracker - Manage Your Finances Easily

## About the Project
The Expense Tracker is a simple and intuitive tool that helps you keep track of your expenses. You can add expenses by entering the name, price, and category. The app provides a clear overview of all your expenses, displays the total amount spent, and allows you to filter expenses by category.
